       <h2>Fixed Full-height Side Nav</h2>
       <h3>Try to scroll this area, and see how the sidenav sticks to the page</h3>
       <p>Notice that this div element has a left margin of 25%.
         This is because the side navigation is set to 25% width. 
         If you remove the margin, the sidenav will overlay/sit on top of this div.</p>
       <p>Also notice that we have set overflow:auto to sidenav.
         This will add a scrollbar when the sidenav is too long 
         (for example if it has over 50 links inside of it).</p>
       <p>Philosophy (from Greek φιλοσοφία, philosophia, literally "love of wisdom") 
         is the study of general and fundamental problems concerning matters such as existence,
         knowledge, values, reason, mind, and language.The term was probably coined by Pythagoras 
         (c. 570–495 BCE). Philosophical methods include questioning, critical discussion, 
         rational argument, and systematic presentation. Classic philosophical questions include:
         Is it possible to know anything and to prove it?
         What is most real? Philosophers also pose more practical and concrete questions such as:
         Is there a best way to live? Is it better to be just or unjust 
         (if one can get away with it)? Do humans have free will?</p>
       <p>Historically,"philosophy" encompassed any body of knowledge.
         From the time of Ancient Greek philosopher Aristotle to the 19th century,
         "natural philosophy" encompassed astronomy, medicine, and physics.
          For example, Newton's 1687 Mathematical Principles of Natural Philosophy later became
          classified as a book of physics. In the 19th century, the growth of modern research
          universities led academic philosophy and other disciplines to professionalize and specialize.
          In the modern era, some investigations that were traditionally part of philosophy became
          separate academic disciplines, including psychology, sociology, linguistics, and economics.</p>
